# Inference Library

**NOTE:** This project is primarily intended as a pedagogical vehicle
for demonstrating the software development process to students in
the Software Construction course at Murray State University. Others are
welcome to use and/or assist with the development of this library,
but please understand that the direction, timeline and processes
employed will be determined solely by what is beneficial to the
aforementioned students.

## Introduction

This is a simple library for analyzing samples of text and assigning them a list of possible data types. Currently, the library only supports the testing of a single text sample at a time, but ultimately it will support the following:

* Analyzing a collection of samples and providing estimates for the likelihood of each candidate type
* Analyzing documents and annotating them with type information
* Analyzing collections of documents and annotating them with type information and estimates for the likelihood of each candidate type
* Analyzing streaming data to handle very large collections of data
* Generating code which can deserialize documents while providing more type safety than using, e.g., maps of strings

## Usage

To start using the inference library, add the following repository to your
pom.xml file

```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>inference-mvn-repo</id>
        <url>https://raw.github.com/MSUCSC430/Inference/mvn-repo/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

And then add the dependency

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>edu.murraystate.csis</groupId>
    <artifactId>inference</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
